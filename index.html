            <p>Here we are at the beginning of a New Year! 2022 is here with all the promise and potential that every
                New
                Year provides us. Of course, as with every New Year, there are many things that are beyond our control.
                But
                it is important to focus on what we can control. Among them are our attitudes, our conduct, our words,
                and
                our goals. </p>

                <p>Great organizations and companies have vision and mission statements. They also have themes each
                    year
                    that are reflective of their goals. Whether it’s a Fortune 500 company, a church or any other
                    organization, it’s important that everyone on the team knows what the goals are so they can work
                    together towards achieving those goals. As a reminder, they put out a theme for the year to help
                    everyone in the organization to remain focused on reaching the goals. </p>

            <p>I think that same principle is important in our individual lives. We all need to have a vision about
                what we want to accomplish this year, and set some goals that will move us toward accomplishing the
                vision. Finally, having a personal theme for the year can help you stay focused on reaching your
                goals. </p>

                    <p>“I must decrease and He must increase” means that you should put God’s needs and will above
                        your
                        own. You should recognize that His message and will are more important than your own. This
                        is
                        not an easy theme to follow. It will go against human nature. But by trying to decrease so
                        that
                        the Lord can increase in your life, you will be more content and He will be glorified
