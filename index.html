        <h1 class="color"> Mission 2022</h1>

        <p>Here we are at the beginning of a New Year! 2022 is here with all the promise and potential that every New
            Year provides us. Of course, as with every New Year, there are many things that are beyond our control. But
            it is important to focus on what we can control. Among them are our attitudes, our conduct, our words, and
            our goals. </p>
